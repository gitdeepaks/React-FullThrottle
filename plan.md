Personalized learning path that takes you from the basics of React to mastering Next.js by the end of November:

**August (React Fundamentals):**

1. **Week 1-2**: Start with the basics of React. Cover topics such as JSX, components (functional and class), props, and state.
2. **Week 3**: Dive into component lifecycle methods and conditional rendering.
3. **Week 4**: Learn about list rendering and forms handling in React.

**September (Intermediate React & State Management):**

1. **Week 1-2**: Start learning about Hooks in React. This includes useState, useEffect, useContext, and useReducer. Implement these hooks in mini-projects for better understanding.
2. **Week 3-4**: Learn about state management with Redux. Understand the concepts of actions, reducers, and the store. Learn how to connect Redux with a React application.

**October (Advanced React & Testing):**

1. **Week 1-2**: Learn about higher-order components and React's context API. Understand error boundaries in React.
2. **Week 3**: Start learning how to test your React applications. Familiarize yourself with testing libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library.
3. **Week 4**: Build a complex project using everything you've learned so far. This could be a full-stack application using the MERN stack.

**November (Next.js):**

1. **Week 1-2**: Start with the basics of Next.js. Understand its directory structure and learn about Next.js routing. Learn how to create dynamic pages.
2. **Week 3**: Dive into server-side rendering and static site generation in Next.js. Understand the getInitialProps, getStaticProps, and getServerSideProps functions.
3. **Week 4**: Learn about API routes and middleware in Next.js. Build a full-stack application using Next.js.

Throughout this path, remember to consistently practice what you've learned by building projects. The projects will give you hands-on experience and help consolidate your understanding of the concepts.

This plan assumes a consistent learning schedule with a reasonable amount of time devoted each week. Feel free to adjust it as per your needs and pace.

Lastly, remember to make use of the rich ecosystem of online resources available, including the official React and Next.js docs, online tutorials, forums, and coding communities. Good luck with your learning!
